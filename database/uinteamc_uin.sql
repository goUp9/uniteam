(5, 'uinteam''s innovative process', '<p>Nowadays searching on online marketplaces has become the norm for people who are looking for a service. After all, doing this is much easier than browsing through the Yellow Pages or the phone book, calling the service providers in your area, and getting quotes from each of them. But what you have to know is this: while traditional online marketplaces are great, they&#39;re not the only options you have. If you want to find the best service provider within the shortest possible time, you&#39;ll want to use the automatic selection process that uinteam provides.</p>\n\n<p style="text-align:justify">What sets uinteam&#39;s process from others? Well, when you search for providers on other online marketplaces, most of them just generate a list of the businesses within your town or city. This list is usually arranged in alphabetical order and/or mentioned the businesses that are nearest to you first, so it&#39;s up to you to check these service providers individually and find out if they&#39;re any good. This involves browsing through their pages to know what they have to offer, checking what their qualifications and experiences are, and reading the feedback that their previous clients have left &mdash; a time-consuming process that will take you minutes,&nbsp;hours or even days?</p>\n\n<p style="text-align:justify">This isn&#39;t what you should expect from uinteam. Through our automatic and objective selection process, we consider all businesses matching user&#39;s requirements and select the best supplier&nbsp;based on&nbsp;experience and qualification as well as the feedback provided by previous&nbsp;customers. In short, we take the hard work out of your hands, so the only thing you should do is to select your requirements (what-where-when-budget)&nbsp;and a supplier will be&nbsp;ready to deliver the service you need, where and when you need it, and at budget you offer.</p>\n\n<p style="text-align:justify">The best part of this is that all results are unbiased. Since uinteam does the merit-based sorting for you, you no longer have to trawl through advertisements nor listen to sales spiels &mdash; both of which can influence your choices. As a result, you can avoid hiring someone because they&#39;re persuasive or good at promoting themselves, but because they result to be the best to deliver the service within your specific requirements.</p>\n\n<p style="text-align:justify">uinteam&#39;s process works well particularly if you quickly need a service that you&#39;re not familiar with and don&#39;t know the criteria that you should look for in service providers. Through the automatic selection process, you don&#39;t have to worry about choosing the right person or business since uinteam will do it for you!</p>\n\n<p style="text-align:justify">Furthermore, when you are not familiar with the service you need, uinteam can also assist you with competent Advisers, whose only purpose is to provide you with advices to get the best deal. They might be Suppliers, and they might even compete for the deal themselves.&nbsp;When advised deals are successful, Advisers will&nbsp;be&nbsp;rewarded by uinteam&nbsp; with a percentage of the deal&#39;s transaction .</p>\n\n<p style="text-align:justify">Haven&#39;t tried using uinteam yet? Don&#39;t worry since it&#39;s incredibly simple: just type in the search bar&nbsp;&lsquo;What (the service you need)&rsquo;,&nbsp;click &ldquo;Ask or Supply or Become an Adviser&#39;&nbsp;then choose&nbsp;When (the time you need it), and Where (the location you want it delivered at).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style="text-align:justify">Can&#39;t find what you need? There&#39;s no need to fret since uinteam allows you to create new tags if the service you want isn&#39;t on the system yet.</p>\n\n<p style="text-align:justify">uinteam&#39;s automatic selection process makes finding the right suppliers easier and less stressful. So what are you waiting for? Visit http://uinteam.com/ now and enjoy the delivery of the services you need!</p>\n', 'innovative,marketplace,quote,online,automatic,selection,time consuming,objective,experience,qualification,feedback,what,where,when,budget,unbiased,merit,hiring,deliver,quickly,adviser,simple,tag,easy', '2016-06-20 23:33:14');
